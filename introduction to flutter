What is Dart?
Dart is a modern, high-level programming language developed by Google. It is designed to be:

Fast – optimized for high performance

Productive – simple syntax and strong tooling

Cross-platform – used for mobile, web, desktop, and server apps

Key features of Dart:

Object-Oriented (everything is an object)

Strongly typed (helps catch errors early)

Supports async/await for asynchronous programming

Can be compiled to native machine code or JavaScript

Dart is commonly used to build applications with smooth user interfaces and good performance.

What is Flutter?

Flutter is a UI framework (also by Google) used to build cross-platform applications from a single codebase. With Flutter, you can create:

Android apps

iOS apps

Web apps

Desktop apps (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Flutter focuses on building beautiful, responsive user interfaces using widgets.

Relationship Between Dart and Flutter

The relationship between Dart and Flutter is very close:

Flutter uses Dart as its programming language

All Flutter apps are written entirely in Dart

Dart provides the logic, while Flutter provides the UI framework

In simple terms:

Dart = the language
Flutter = the framework built with Dart

Why Flutter Uses Dart

Flutter uses Dart because:

High performance – Dart compiles to native code (no bridge like some other frameworks)

Fast development – features like Hot Reload allow instant UI updates

Easy UI creation – Dart works well with Flutter’s widget-based design

Single codebase – one Dart codebase runs on multiple platforms
