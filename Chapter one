Problem Statement
 1. Introduction to the Context of the Problem
The growing issue of misplaced, lost, and unclaimed items within universities and public institutions continues to pose challenges to both students and administrators. Traditional systems such as physical notice boards, manual logbooks, and social media groups are inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to data duplication or loss. These outdated methods often lack verification, traceability, and security, which makes the recovery process unreliable and discourages active participation from the campus community.
In many cases, valuable personal belongings remain unclaimed due to the absence of a structured and automated tracking system. As a result, students experience frustration and loss of trust in existing recovery channels. This situation emphasizes the need for a simplified and secure digital platform designed to streamline the reporting, tracking, and recovery of lost items within the university environment — ensuring efficiency, accountability, and convenience for all users.
2. Identification of the Core Problem
Despite the rapid advancement of digital technologies, most institutions still struggle with inefficient methods for recovering and managing lost items. Current digital lost-and-found platforms rely heavily on manual keyword searches or visual browsing, which are slow, error-prone, and often inaccurate. This inefficiency causes many students to abandon searches altogether, resulting in unclaimed items and frustration.
The introduction of AI-powered image recognition presents a breakthrough opportunity. By allowing users to upload images of lost or found items, the system can automatically match similar objects based on visual characteristics rather than text descriptions. This would make the process faster, more reliable, and scalable compared to traditional keyword-based search methods. However, most existing systems fail to incorporate this technology effectively, leaving a major gap in automation, accuracy, and user convenience within campus environments.
3. Sub-Problems or Specific Challenges
The core problem can be further broken down into the following specific challenges:
a. Inefficient Item Identification: Manual reporting and keyword-based searches are time-consuming and frequently inaccurate. Without AI-assisted recognition, many items remain unmatched, lowering the success rate of recovery operations.
b. Poor User Engagement and Communication: Most lost-and-found systems do not provide real-time interaction between users and administrators. The absence of notifications, confirmations, or instant feedback discourages users from engaging actively with the platform.
c. Lack of Donation Integration: Unclaimed items often go unused or are disposed of improperly. A structured donation system could enable responsible reallocation of these resources to those in need, fostering community benefit.
d. Data Fragmentation: Existing methods lack integration between reporting, recovery, and donation modules, resulting in disjointed operations.
e. Limited Transparency and Trust: Without a centralized verification system, students cannot easily track the progress of their reports or donations. This creates distrust in the process and reduces confidence in digital recovery platforms.
4. Evidence of the Problem
Research has shown that lost and found management systems relying on manual processes often have less than 40% recovery success rates (tan and chong.,2022). Also Modern approaches integrating AI automation have been shown to improve recognition accuracy and response time, Studies or Chinese research indicate how AI integration improve image recognition accuracy and processing time across various fields(zhao yanhui, fan xinnin, xie ming, 2019) . Furthermore, university environments in Nigeria still rely largely on social media groups and physical notice boards to recover lost property, which are unreliable, untraceable, and prone to misinformation. Leading to over 76% of lost items on campus not being able to be recovered by owners and also 68% of items found by other people could not be return to the original owners due to untraceable inefficiency of available lost and found management systems (An effective lost and found management system in campus tan and chong 2019)
Recent findings also highlight that incorporating donation integration within community driven platforms fosters sustainability and strengthens community engagement. In our own situation it will give room to more charity engagement By redirecting unclaimed items toward charitable use, institutions can minimize waste, encourage social responsibility among students, and promote a culture of shared value within the campus ecosystem. These insights collectively justify the development of a smart, system solution that combines reporting, tracking, donation management, and community participation in one integrated platform. 
5. Consequences of the Problem
If this problem remains unaddressed, several adverse consequences may persist:
- Loss of Valuable Property: Students continue losing personal items due to inefficient reporting systems.
- Reduced Trust and Community Morale: Delays and lack of transparency cause mistrust between students and administrators, as many assume their belongings were stolen or ignored. This fosters tension and reduces the sense of security on campus.
- Administrative Overload: Manual tracking and verification consume staff time that could be spent on other institutional duties.
- Missed Opportunities for Social Impact: Items that could be repurposed through donations remain wasted, limiting community engagement and sustainability efforts.
- Unfavorable Campus Environment: Poor item recovery experiences discourage participation, reduce confidence in digital systems, and make the environment less conducive for collaboration and engagement.
6. The Gap in Existing Systems
Most existing lost-and-found platforms lack AI automation, real-time data synchronization, and integration with donation or event modules. They operate as isolated tools rather than connected ecosystems. Additionally, few systems are customized to suit educational institutions, where student identification, accountability, and transparency are essential. This gap creates an opportunity for a specialized solution tailored to the dynamic and collaborative environment of Nile University.
7. The Need for the Proposed System
To overcome these challenges, there is a need for a smart, AI-integrated solution that leverages technologies such as AI image recognition and automated donation recommendations to simplify and secure the recovery of lost items. Integrating event notification features within the same platform would ensure that students stay informed about campus activities, including donation-related events, further promoting awareness and participation.
Such a system would not only enhance operational efficiency but also support sustainable practices by connecting recovery, reuse, and community engagement in one unified ecosystem. By providing automation, transparency, and accessibility, the proposed platform aligns with institutional digital transformation goals and contributes to the broader Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to innovation, reduced waste, and community development.
8. Summary of the Problem Statement
In summary, the current methods of managing lost and found items at Nile University are outdated, fragmented, and inefficient. They fail to utilize modern technologies capable of improving accuracy, speed, and trust. This project proposes the development of a mobile-based smart ecosystem that integrates AI-driven item recognition, donation management, and event notifications to simplify and secure item recovery while promoting social responsibility within the campus.
By addressing both the technological and social dimensions of the issue, this project demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to digital transformation in academic
